Hello my name is Dwight Coles III. This is a simple project that
creates a matrix class and uses dynamic memory allocation and
includes matrix operations both in the form of regular functions
and operator overloading. Matrix.cpp is a class in which a defines
the functions from Matrix.H. In the Matrix.cpp class, I used many
functions, many loops, and many temporary classes of matrixes to
keep up with the information and variables.

To compile this program:
     - $ make
     
After compiling, you are now ready to run.

To run the assn06 file:
   - $ make run
